# ⚡ RenderShift

RenderShift is a **progressive 3D model loader** built with **Three.js** and **Node.js**.  
It reduces 3D model loading time by starting with lightweight, low-detail versions (LOD) and dynamically upgrading to higher-quality meshes as they become available — all in real time.

### 🚀 Features
- Progressive Level-of-Detail (LOD) loading
- Smooth transitions between model resolutions
- Upload + auto LOD generation using gltfpack
- Three.js frontend for instant model rendering
- Designed for large GLTF/GLB models (200–500 MB)

### 🧩 Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Three.js, HTML/JS  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express  
**Model Processing:** gltfpack / Blender CLI
